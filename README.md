# Logic Gate Simulator

Use this basic digital electronic simulator to build and share anything from small blinking lights to massive complex computers, your imagination is the only limit. 

Please note that this is an older version of my newer project [Drogic Pro](https://github.com/GameDev46/Drogic_Pro), which has a better user interface and more nodes to use in your creations.

## Usage

Simply use the dropdown to select the node type and hit the add node button to add it to the scene. Once added you can move the gate around by clicking down, dragging and dropping it. To connect gates simply drag the blue outlined circle in front of a gate (the output) on top of another gate to make it act as an input to this gate.

## Gates

*INPUT* - Click to toggle its output high and low

*OUTPUT* - Lights up when the input is high and turns off when the input is low

*CLOCK* - Toggles its output from high to low at fixed time intervals

*BUFFER* - Leaves the signal unaffected

*TOGGLE* - Toggles from low to high every time its input goes from low to high

--------

*NOT* - NOT Gate

*AND* - AND Gate

*NAND* - NAND Gate

*OR* - OR Gate

*NOR* - NOR Gate

*XOR* - XOR Gate

--------

FULL ADDER - Takes in 3 inputs (bit 1, bit 2 and previous carry bit) and has 2 outputs (the sum of bit 1 and bit 2 and carry bit)

## Saving and Loading

To save your creations simply press the save button on the top navigation bar and copy the provided save URL and paste it to a file on your device ready to be loaded later.

To load your creation simply copy the saved creation URL and paste it into your browser of choice and it will bring you back to the website and load your saved creation ready for you to continue editing it!
