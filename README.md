# Logic Gate Simulator

Use this basic digital electronic simulator to build and share anything from small blinking lights to massive complex computers, your imagination is the only limit

## Usage

Simply use the dropdown to select the node type and hit the add node button to add it to the scene. Once added you can move the gate around by clicking down, dragging and dropping it. To connect gates simply drag the blue outlined circle in front of a gate (the output) on top of another gate to make it act as an input to this gate.

## Gates

*INPUT* - Click to toggle its output high and low

*OUTPUT* - Lights up when the input is high and turns off when the input is low

*CLOCK* - Toggles its output from high to low at fixed time intervals

*BUFFER* - Leaves the signal unaffected

*TOGGLE* - Toggles from low to high every time its input goes from low to high

--------

*NOT* - NOT Gate

*AND* - AND Gate

*NAND* - NAND Gate

*OR* - OR Gate

*NOR* - NOR Gate

*XOR* - XOR Gate

--------

FULL ADDER - Takes in 3 inputs (bit 1, bit 2 and previous carry bit) and has 2 outputs (the sum of bit 1 and bit 2 and carry bit)
